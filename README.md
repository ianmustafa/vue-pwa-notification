## About Vue PWA Notification

Vue PWA Notification is a simple app with push notification, built with Vue.js and Firebase Cloud Messaging. This is a result of me learning about push notification using Push API and its implementation in Vue.js, with help of [this article by Niishi Kubo](https://medium.com/@n11sh1/how-to-build-pwa-w-vue-cli-3-service-workers-add-to-home-screen-push-notifications-b519c49e142d).
